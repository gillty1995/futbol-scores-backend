**Intro**

This project is a dynamic football scores website that allows users to save and track their favorite games. Users can register, log in, and save specific matches, which they can later view or remove from their saved list. The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database for storing user data and game details. Key features include user authentication, data validation, and an organized structure for handling saved games, making it an efficient tool for football enthusiasts who want to stay updated on their favorite teams and matches.

**Technologies**

    •	Node.js: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side.
    •	Express.js: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
    •	MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing application data.
    •	Mongoose: ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.
    •	Celebrate: Middleware for validating request data.
    •	CORS: Middleware for enabling cross-origin requests.
    •	dotenv: Module for loading environment variables from a .env file.
    •	pm2: Process manager for Node.js applications.

**Techniques**

    •	Middleware: Implementation of middleware for request logging, error handling, and security enhancements.
    •	Rate Limiting: Protection against brute-force attacks using a rate limiter.
    •	Database Connection: Established a connection to MongoDB with error handling.
    •	Error Handling: Centralized error handling using custom middleware.

**Final Thoughts**

Building this football scores website has been a rewarding experience that deepened my understanding of full-stack development. I learned to effectively manage user authentication, handle complex data structures, and implement robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience. The use of middleware for validation and security has also enhanced the overall reliability of the application. I look forward to expanding this project by adding more features, such as real-time score updates and notifications for users, making it an even more valuable resource for football fans. Thank you for taking the time to explore my project!
